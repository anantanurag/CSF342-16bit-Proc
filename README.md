16 Bit RISC Processor

Made Controller, with testing for proper state flows but not whether each control signal is correct or not. 
Will check individual control signals when they malfunction in the datapath!!

States only tested for ADD Register type instruction, works decently. Will check for other instructions as and when they come up in the datapath.
